# Data-Envelopment-Analysis
DEA is a linear programming method for comparing the relative productivity (or efficiency) of multiple service units. This project is about performing DEA for Hope valley health care association 
Problem Statement: The Hope Valley Health Care Association owns and operates six nursing homes in adjoining states. An evaluation of their efficiency has been undertaken using two inputs and two outputs. The inputs are staffing labor (measured in average hours per day) and the cost of supplies (in thousands of dollars per day). The outputs are the number of patient-days reimbursed by third-party sources and the number of patient-days reimbursed privately.

For this assignment, I performed DEA Analysis under FDH, CRS, VRS, IRS, DRS, and FRH assumptions. Also identify peers and lambda for each assumption. The respository includes the rmd file and html output for this analysis.
